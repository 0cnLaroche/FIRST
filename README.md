## Modules
3 modules allow users to navigate and find financial coding for :
* **Cost Centers**
* **Projects**
* **RUN**

With **administrator credentials**, users can update or add new codes.

## Exporting data
Users can export data from the export module in excel format. Eventually, we want to be able to extract report from the cost model.

## IT Cost Model Integration

The application is made to integrate the IT Cost Model with an import functionality and index management.
